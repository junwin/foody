cd k3node

npm install

you can test the bot using: https://download.botframework.com/bf-v3/tools/emulator/publish.htm

You need to have Mongo DB available e.g.
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath d:\mongodb\data
"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongo.exe" 

Bots need to be registered this is done at https://dev.botframework.com/ and has been done for the sample.

You can add this to your own Skype contact list with the following link:

The sample has not been published for a general audience - so you cannot search for it from Skype.

It also works with a lot of other channels, http://enablingwebchat.com/, Facebook messenger and so on
